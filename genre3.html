        <h1>Artist: Bad Bad Not Good</h1>
          <div class="genre_text">
            <p>BADBADNOTGOOD made a name for itself by 
          reworking songs from the likes of Nas and Ol' Dirty Bastard, eventually catching 
          the attention of Odd Future leader Tyler, the Creator. The masses took notice in 
          2015 when the group produced an entire LP for Ghostface Killah, Sour Soul. 
          BADBADNOTGOOD has been called a hip-hop ensemble, but its foundation is clearly jazz, 
          which provides a gateway to countless genres. On IV, the group allows that gateway to 
          widen, adding soul and funk to the repertoire. Still only in their 20s, the band's 
          members never seemed intimidated by the intimate nature of the Tiny Desk; if anything, it 
          accentuated their enthusiasm. This was their zone. They played three selections from IV â€” 
          including "Cashmere," which only slightly veered from the studio version, and "In Your 
          Eyes," which features Charlotte Day Wilson's vocals. The tight arrangement allowed Wilson 
          to hover gently above the instrumentation, showing off the band's most promising work to 
          date. It was a pleasure to have BADBADNOTGOOD at the desk for IV and exciting to imagine 
          what's in store for V, VI and beyond.</p>
