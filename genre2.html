        <h1>Artist: King Krule</h1>
          <div class="genre_text">
            <p>The Ooz, the title to King Krule's latest album, is the perfect name for 
            his music. It conjures, in my mind, a word mashup of "cool" and "jazz." The 
            music is eerily evocative with lyrics that talk about the sorts of depression 
            singer and guitarist Archy Marshall has dealt with in his young life. And, at 
            23, he has a lot to say on the subject. His opening song at the Tiny Desk, 
            "Midnight 01 (Deep Sea Diver)," includes the line, "Why'd you leave me? 
            Because of my depression? / You used to complete me but I guess I learnt a 
            lesson." The song continues with water-sinking metaphors and how he deals with 
            the pressure. All this comes from someone who honestly looks like he couldn't 
            care less, which seems like a far cry from the words and care he puts into his 
            twisted, woozy tones. Those tones are played here by five other musicians, 
            including sax, guitars, bass, drums, live vocal processing of Archy's voice 
            and electronics. It's a winning path down a musical road rarely traveled and 
            an acquired taste well worth dipping in.</p>
