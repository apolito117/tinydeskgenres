      <h1>Artist: Khruangbin</h1>
        <div class="genre_text">
            <p>It was daylight but the music was dark and moody. And 
            despite having the office lights turned on high, it was Khruangbin's trance-inducing 
            tone that set the mood and carried me away. This trio from Houston, Texas is heavily 
            inspired by 1960s and '70s funk and soul from, of all places, Thailand. That musical 
            passion has taken them on a journey that, these days, incorporates music from Spain, 
            Ethiopia and the Middle East. Khruangbin's largely instrumental music is grounded in 
            Laura Lee's bass, with Mark Speer playing those melodic, richly reverbed guitar sounds
            and Donald "DJ" Johnson on drums and piano. Two of the three songs performed at this 
            Tiny Desk Concert are from their 2018 album Con Todo El Mundo, which is dedicated in 
            part to Laura Lee's Mexican-American grandfather. He'd often ask her how much she 
            loved him and the response that pleased him most was when she would say, "con todo el 
            mundo," (with all the world.) The third track in this performance is one of the band's
            first forays into vocals, from their 2015 debut album, The Universe Smiles Upon You. 
            "White Gloves" gently pays homage to a "classy lady" who was "a fighter" and who 
            "died in a fight." Its open-ended lyrics could imply a battle that was violent or an 
            illness. It isn't clear. What is clear is the reverence in the song and in this music that 
            strays from typical instrumental songs with heavy beats. This is music to sway to and to lift 
            you beyond the day to day.</p>
