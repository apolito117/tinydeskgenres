        <h1>Artist: Gucci Mane</h1>
          <div class="genre_text">
            <p>Gucci Mane's smile makes you feel like 
            s still some good in the world. He's really earned it, and that thing is infectious. 
            We asked him to come to NPR because we wanted to be a part of the victory tour he's 
            been on this year: In the past six months or so, Gucci Mane was released early from 
            the federal penitentiary; he proposed to his girlfriend on the kiss cam at a Hawks 
            game, and she said yes; he's releasing a total of three albums, all over which he 
            celebrates his newly committed sobriety; he and Courtney Love look like they get 
            along; and he remade "Jingle Bells." In this Tiny Desk concert, Gucci Mane performed 
            with just his longtime producer and friend, Zaytoven, on piano. Their version of 
            stripped-down is a minimal backing track and plenty of church-groomed trills. They 
            performed with the understanding that everyone in the room knew their songs one 
            from 2009 and two from this year  and knew that this performance would represent a 
            surreal dip into a parallel universe where ingenuity is rewarded, snobbery is gone 
            and love is real. Gucci Mane agreed to this unlikely set as a gesture to those people
            â€” for remembering his work while he was away, and for cheering on his resurgence, his
            health, his charm and his singular nature.</p>
